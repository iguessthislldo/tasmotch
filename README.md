# Tasmotch

Tasmotch (*Tasmota* + *switch*) is a basic ESP8266 program for controlling
other devices that are running [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/).

Once configured, built, and running, it matches Tasmota devices based on name
and publishes commands to them to power on or off based on the GPIO input.
